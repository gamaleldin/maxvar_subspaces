% The following code checks for the relevant MEX files (such as .mexa64
% or .mexglx, depending on the machine architecture), and it creates the
% mex file if it can not find the right one.

% Create the mex file if necessary.
% this template project has no MEX, but if relevant, there is good
% functionality in startup_checkMEX (see toeplitz project)
